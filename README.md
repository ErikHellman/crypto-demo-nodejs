# Demo of various crypto functions

This is project is part of the security lecture for a fullstack developer course.

The intention with these are to illustrate how the different types of cryptographic functions work.

Currently included:

- SHA256 hash function
- Base64 encoding
- AES (symmetric) encryption and decryption
- Bcrypt (Blowfish) encryption and decryption
- RSA (asymmetric, or public/private key) encryption and decryption
